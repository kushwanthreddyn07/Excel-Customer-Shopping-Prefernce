# Customer Shopping Preferences

I created an Excel dashboard using data about consumer behavior and purchasing patterns and got the data from Kaggle. I got a clean dataset and not much cleaning was neededâ€”link here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset/data. I have used a few formulas like AVERAGE, COUNTA, COUNTIF, SUM, and SUMIF for analysis. Attached is the Excel file for reference.
